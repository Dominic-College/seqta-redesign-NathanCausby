<h1> Dominic Bus rules and etiquette <span><br>
  Grade 7-10:</span> </h1>
<h3> When catching the bus to and from school,
  it is important to understand the bus rules and etiquette.
  If you understand these rules the bus will be a more enjoyable experience for everyone.<br>
  Transport at the College is continually revised to maintain efficiency and safety. The College is served by both Metro Services and some private services.<br>
  We recommend Parents contact bus companies directly for the most up to date information available. </h3>
